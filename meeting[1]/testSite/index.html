This is a comment. You'll see a lot of these.
Make sure you check out the html page that does not contain comments.
Then you can see what html actually looks like

<!-- 
This tag, <!DOCTYPE html> is REQUIRED for all html pages. It tells your browser that this page should be parsed as html and it will not work if you don't!
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- All your html should go in between the two html tags -->
<html>
    
<!--
This tag is the head tag, it contains metadata, data that is about the html page itself
Anything in the head tag will not be rendered onto your html page
-->
<head>
    <!--
    This is a title, it goes in the head tags and it tells
    the browser what to name the tab! If you live preview this right now you'll see
    the words "Nish's Crap-tastic Website" in the tab!
    -->
    <title>Nish's Crap-tastic Website!</title>
    
    <!-- This links the CSS and html pages together! -->
    <link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
</head>

    <!-- These are body tags. Anything in the body tags will display on the html page! -->
<body>
    <!-- Refer to the PowerPoint to learn about the different body tags. -->
    <h1>NISH'S WEBSITE!</h1>
    <h3>I like frogs.</h3>

        I don't actually like frogs that much. Toads now, well, toads are cool. Have you seen that book Frog and Toad? Yeah well Frog is annoying af, but Toad is the real MVP

        Ok on a serious note, this webpage is lacking a bit. Let's make it look more interesting.

    <!-- a div tag doesn't do anything by itself, it's a container that can be styled in CSS -->
    <div class="left-side">
        <p>I'm going to style all of this content so it's on the left side of the page!</p>
        <!-- This is an anchor tag, you can link to stuff using it -->
        <a href="https://github.com/Nishnha/fullstack">This is a link to the Github page where you can view all of the fullstack notes!</a>

    <div class="right-side">
        <p>I'm going to put all this stuff on the right side of the page!</p>
